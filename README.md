"D-Schedule" is a desktop based application written in java,javafx and Css. Currently tested On a Linux machine (who care's windows anyway)
The application is created to ease Our life (student) "No more procrastination in any task or due". the application has the following Features:

2. The application Can store data Offline (literally this thing is an offline application).
3. Your Password aren't stored in a plain text, all your credentials are encrypted(so you don't have to worry security)
4. Well documented application.
5. The code is free for any kind of distribution, (just don't claim you're the developer)
6. Great Project Structure, No more pain the ass searching for something in project.

The application is Capable of doing many stuff at this date. and hoping we'll find contributors to this dummy application and make it reach more and more users.

To-do:

"D-Schedule" came in to reality for the sake of the following heroes.

3. Credit goes to Google, Stack-over and many more online tutorials.
